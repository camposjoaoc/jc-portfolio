                    ‚ÄúJo√£o was one of my participants in the course IT: Front-end Developer during the fall semester 2024-2025.
                    During the course, Joao showed a great interest for learning to code. He was dedicated to his studies, eager to learn, and really invested his energy into learning as much as he could.
                    This dedication could easily be seen in his assignments. He turned in his assignments on time and with well written and thought-out code.
                    Even when the course got more difficult, Joao always approached each situation calmly and with a positive attitude.
                    He was happy to help any other participant that needed it and was patient with those who needed help.
                    It was an absolute joy to have Joao in my course and I wish him all the best in the future. I hope our paths cross again!‚Äù
